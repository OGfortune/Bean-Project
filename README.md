This project aims to evaluate the performance of various classifier models on the UCI Dry Bean dataset, which contains features of different types of dry beans. The objective is to test the effectiveness of k-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest models in classifying the types of dry beans based on their features. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices will be utilized to assess the models' performance.

Additionally, the project addresses a scenario where one type of bean ('Sira') is moderately poisonous. To address this, methods for improving the classification performance specifically for the 'Sira' class will be explored. The focus will be on identifying a suitable evaluation metric and implementing techniques to mitigate the impact of misclassifying 'Sira' beans, while minimizing the impact on the classification of other bean types.

The project repository will contain a Python notebook detailing the data loading process, model training and evaluation, as well as discussions on the results and approaches to improve classification performance for the 'Sira' class. Relevant resources and libraries such as imbalanced-learn and RandomForestClassifier's class_weight parameter will be referenced and utilized to enhance the classification performance.
